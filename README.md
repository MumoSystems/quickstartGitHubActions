GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that run tests whenever you push a change to your repository, or that deploy merged pull requests to production.

This quickstart guide shows you how to use the user interface of GitHub to add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.

To get started with preconfigured workflows, browse through the list of templates in the actions/starter-workflows repository. For more information, see Using workflow templates.

For an overview of GitHub Actions workflows, see Workflows. If you want to learn about the various components that make up GitHub Actions, see Understanding GitHub Actions.
